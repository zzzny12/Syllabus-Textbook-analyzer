# Syllabus Textbook Analyzer
Syllabus Textbook Analyzer is an R-based web application hosted on shinyapp.io server. This application is used to find the best matched textbook based on the syllabus information. After uploading data file in the correct place, user can click the Analyze" buttom to show similarity score and Cluster Group in the Scoring result page. Similarity score only shows when file format is correct. 

# Document format
Syllabus information should be 'txt' format. Textbook should be 'csv' format. In the textbook database, there should be two columns. One is 'title', another is 'description'. User can use information from table of contents as the description instead of full details in the textbook.

# Data file in the project
I upload SYLLABUS.txt and textbook.csv for user to test the app. The textbook information from OpenStax which is free source book website.
