COURSE DESCRIPTION[EF3][AF4] Special Topics Course Description:  This seminar will enhance the curriculum by identifying, analyzing, and applying special topics pertinent to the Management and Systems degree. The specific titles and content of each seminar will change to reflect emerging areas of interest, which can only be determined at the time of offering. The course may be used to satisfy the elective degree requirement. Applicability to specific concentrations will be noted in the course schedule and is at the department’s discretion.                   Text Data Mining Course Description  This course will cover the primary techniques for mining and analyzing text data to discover interesting patterns, extract practical knowledge, and support decision-making, emphasizing statistical approaches that can be generally applied to arbitrary text data in any natural language with no or minimum human effort.  Detailed analysis of text data requires an understanding of natural language text, which is a difficult task for computers. However, several statistical approaches have been shown to work well for the "shallow" but robust analysis of text data for pattern finding and knowledge discovery. You will learn the basic concepts, principles, and major algorithms in text mining and their potential applications. This course describes a range of business opportunities and solutions centered around the use of text. It also identifies sources of competitive intelligence in text and provides solutions for parsing and storing incoming knowledge. It is based on the merging technology of natural language processing. It uses real-world case studies, and the course provides examples of the most useful statistical and machine learning techniques for handling text, semantic, and social data. We then describe how and what you can infer from the data and discuss practical approaches for visualizing and communicating the results to decision-makers. COURSE PREREQUISITES:  GC1240 – Information Technology and Data Analytics GC1210 – Quantitative Models for Decision Makers[EF5][AF6]  COURSE STRUCTURE/METHOD    This course will be delivered Online - Synchronous, once a week on Wednesdays.

Excused absences are granted in cases of documented serious illness, family emergency, religious observance, or civic obligation.  In the case of religious observance or civic responsibility, this should be reported in advance.  Unexcused absences from sessions may have a negative impact on a student’s final grade.  Students are responsible for assignments given during any absence.  Each unexcused absence may result in a student’s grade being lowered by a letter grade. A student who has three unexcused absences may earn a Fail grade. University Calendar Policy on Religious Holidays: https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/university-calendar-policy-on-religious-holidays.html Students who join the course during add/drop are responsible for ensuring that they identify what assignments and preparatory work they have missed and complete and submit those per the syllabus.  Classroom Expectations As graduate students, you are expected to conduct yourselves professionally and engage and collaborate with your classmates in the Zoom meeting room. Here are our guiding principles: • Dress as if you are in the Classroom. • Keep your microphone muted unless asking a question or engaging in discussion. • Check your video and audio when entering your class session. • Think background, minimize distractions around you. • Look into the camera instead of looking at the screen. • Type quietly, mute if necessary. • Don’t eat during a Zoom class session and refrain from engaging in any activity such as smoking, consuming alcohol, etc., that you would not engage in if the class was in person. SPS classrooms are diverse and include students who range in age, culture, learning styles, and levels of professional experience. To maintain an inclusive environment that ensures all students can equally participate with and learn from each other and receive feedback and instruction from faculty during group discussions in the Classroom, all course-based discussions and group projects should occur in a language that is shared among all participants. Assignments Students are expected to participate in each class session by understanding the subject, sharing ideas, or discussing/commenting on other students' comments.  In addition, students must complete and submit all assigned homework on time.  Late submission of homework will either not be accepted or will result in a lower grade.  Students are also expected to develop with and present a team project with other students and take and pass a midterm exam and a final exam.   See full detail of expectations under “Assessment Strategy” below. Further information about specific assignments can also be found in the “Course Outline” section. Technology Policy Use of either PC or Mac desktop or laptop will be needed to access all course content/materials, notes, assignments, and examples and demos. All class sessions require the use of Zoom.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AND PLAGIARISM POLICY All students are expected to be honest and ethical in all academic work. This trust is shared among all university community members and is a core principle of American higher education. Any breaches of this trust will be taken seriously. A hallmark of the educated student and good scholarship is the ability to acknowledge information derived from others. Students are expected to be scrupulous in crediting those sources that have contributed to developing their ideas.  Plagiarism involves borrowing or using information from other sources without proper and full credit. Students are expected to demonstrate how what they have learned incorporates an understanding of the research and expertise of scholars and other appropriate experts; and thus, recognizing others' published work or teachings—whether that of authors, lecturers, or one's peers—is a required practice in all academic projects.  Students are subject to disciplinary actions for the following offenses, which include but are not limited to: Cheating; Plagiarism; Forgery or unauthorized use of documents; False form of identification  Use the link below to read more about Academic Integrity Policies at the NYU School of Professional Studies. Academic Policies for NYU SPS Students https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/student-experience/policies-and-procedures.html#Graduate1 TURNITIN TurnItIn is a plagiarism detection software used to verify academic originality.  It is available only to degree courses and students.  Some assignments in this course may be checked by the instructor for plagiarism using Turnitin. Most assignments will be checked using the plagiarism tool in the grammar checking software Grammarly.

COURSE OUTLINE[EF9][AF10]  [EF1]Locked this version and added the required areas from the Syllabus Guidelines for Fall 2021 [AF2R1]OK [EF3]I couldn’t verify because this isn’t on the website yet.. [AF4R3]The website would not have the text data mining course description because it only carries the special topics generic description. No special topics courses have specific course descriptions. [EF5]Added  [AF6R5]Thank you [EF7]We are not using points [AF8R7]fixed [EF9]There isn’t an outline week by week. The guidelines states no table. [AF10R9]Sorry at this late hour I will not convert this table, which is very clear into a text narrative running many pages which students hardly read.
